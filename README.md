# Description

•	This repository is meant to showcase various projects that implement machine learning algorithims 

# Black Friday Sales

•	The central goal of this analysis is to gain insights into this hypothetical Black Friday sales data and develop predictive models to forecast customer purchases.

•	By exploring and cleaning the dataset, implementing feature engineering, and leveraging machine learning techniques, I aimed to understand the factors influencing purchase behavior and build models capable of accurate predictions.

•	This report will detail the data cleaning process, the choice of machine learning models, their parameters, evaluation results, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

# Hotel Booking Status

Predictive Modeling for Hotel Booking Cancellations

•	The primary objective is to build predictive neural network and machine learning models for hotel booking cancellations by exploring and analyzing relevant dataset features.

•	Through data exploration and feature engineering, the project aims to uncover patterns in hotel booking data, enhancing the models' ability to make accurate predictions.

•	The project provides a detailed report, covering the data cleaning process, choice of neural network models, their configurations, evaluation metrics, and key findings from the analysis.
