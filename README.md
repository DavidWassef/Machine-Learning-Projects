# Description

•	This repository is meant to showcase various projects that implement machine learning algorithims 

# Black Friday Sales

•	The central goal of this analysis is to gain insights into this hypothetical Black Friday sales data and develop predictive models to forecast customer purchases.

•	By exploring and cleaning the dataset, implementing feature engineering, and leveraging machine learning techniques, I aimed to understand the factors influencing purchase behavior and build models capable of accurate predictions.

•	This report will detail the data cleaning process, the choice of machine learning models, their parameters, evaluation results, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
